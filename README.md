###### PC Infos Application

First make sure you have Python installed or check if Python is installed. 

```
Python
```

If python is installed, this should be displayed: 

`Python 3.11.7 (tags/v3.11.7:fa7a6f2, Dec  4 2023, 19:24:49) [MSC v.1937 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32`

If Python isnt installed you can dowload it here: [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python")

To use this application you must first install psutil, tkinter and GPUtil with "pip install".

```
pip install psutil
pip install tkinter
pip install gputil
```



Then import time, psutil, GPUtil and tkinter as tk. 

```
import time
import psutil
import tkinter as tk
import GPUtil
```

Once this is done you can open the folder and start the file main_update.py and the program should run.
